#Student Marks Predictor
##Project Overview

The Student Marks Predictor is a machine learning project built using Python and scikit-learn.
It predicts a student’s marks based on number of courses enrolled and hours studied per week.
This project helps beginners understand data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction using Linear Regression.

##dataset 
The modal is trained on dataset from kaggle.com you can downlad dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/api/v1/datasets/download/yasserh/student-marks-dataset 

#Features
Predict student marks using Linear Regression.
Evaluate model performance using:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
input for number of courses and hours studied.
Simple and beginner-friendly code.
